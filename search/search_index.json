WoMAD v0.1.0 Log 2025-09-07 : WoMAD's first commits :) - v0.1.1 Deploy Docs Workflow (creation and errors): Although the code is basically thin air at this point, Saameh decided it would be a good idea to finalize the structure of the repository. So, we got our first error. Shocking! I know! This lead to creation of v0.1.1, a mostly empty repository that at least has a decent, mostly empty documents page on a Github page. Log 2025-09-09 : Expansion of Documentation - v0.1.2 Expansion of documentation structure Do you see a pattern? Before outlining the actual .py files, someone decided it would be a good idea to make the document and the Github page for our lovely WoMAD Model perfect. What is perfect? Nobody knows. Our next tasks are: * Outlining all .py files and complete their description docstrings * Outlining the-code.md and the-science.md files * Expand main README.md file Upcoming versions, logs, stages: WoMAD v0.2.0 Data Acquisition & Preprocessing Tasks: Develop functions to download the data Parse the dataset and isolate trials using the EV files Normalize data and save to a DataFrame WoMAD v0.3.0 Core Model Development Tasks: Define PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader Create the 3D U-Net model (segmentation module) Create a training loop (K-fold cross-validation) WoMAD v0.4.0 Parallel Modules & Fusion Module Tasks: Build the feature extraction modules: Temporal module Spatiotemporal module GNN Build the final fusion layer that combines their outputs WoMAD v0.5.0 Complete Model Evaluation & Interpretation Tasks: Evaluate model performance Save model predictions as NIfTI files Save (evaluation and prediction) plots WoMAD v1.0.0 First \"release\" of the \"final\" version of WoMAD Tasks: Finalize all code (well ... as final as it can be) Finalize documentation Add findings to The Science page","title":"Logs"},{"location":"logs/#womad-project-logs","text":"This page includes the logs for our project.
