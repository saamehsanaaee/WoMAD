## Chronological Logs

### WoMAD v0.1.0

#### Log #1: 2025-09-07

**Created the Deploy Docs Workflow (v0.1.1)**

Although the code is basically thin air at this point, Saameh decided it would be a good idea to *finalize* the structure of the repository. So, we got our fist error. Shocking! We know!

Hence, v0.1.1 was created. A mostly empty repository that has a decent, but mostly empty documentation on [our GitHub page](https://saamehsanaaee.github.io/WoMAD)

#### Log #2: 2025-09-09

**Expanded the Documentation structure (v0.1.2)**

Do you see a pattern?

Before outlining the actual `.py` files, *someone* decided it would be a good idea to make the document and the GitHub page for our lovely WoMAD model *better*. What is "better"? Nobody knows.

Our next tasks are:

* Outlining all `.py` files and complete their description docstrings
* Outlining `the-code.md` and `the-science.md` files
* Expand main `README.md` file

#### Log #3: 2025-09-10

**Filled docstrings of the `.py` files to describe each module (v0.1.2)**

The `.py` files are now partially outlined on a very high level. The next step is to make this outline more granular and create the logical flow of the code within each module.

#### Log #4: 2025-09-18

**Outlined all `.py` files to create the basic structure of the modules (v0.1.3)**

The `.py` files are now properly outlined. The next step is to populate each section with their respective functions.
